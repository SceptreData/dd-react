## Thinking in React: Stateful Components

A short article where we build a UI Color Picker using React Hooks.
We explain where state should exist inside of your components,
and how that relates to hooks.

_This project has been built with the React framework [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). We used the theme [Gatsby Waves](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-theme-waves/) for the presentational effects._

*By Danine Noble and David Bergeron*


Hello, My name is David, and that other author over there is Danine. 
Together, we are going to be breaking down and building a React component. On the
menu today we have everyone's favorite UI widget: **The Color Picker**.

Here's the plan:
1. First, we're going to pull apart all the little pieces that you find in a color picker.
2. Then, piece by piece, we're going to build the component.
3. Last, but certainly not least we will pick some *groovy* colors.


<CodeWave>

```jsx
function HelloWorld({
  greeting = "hello",
  greeted = '"World"',
  silent = false,
  onMouseOver,
}) {
  // TODO write more code
}
```

```js
function HelloWorld({
  greeting = "hello",
  greeted = '"World"',
  silent = false,
  onMouseOver,
}) {
  if (!greeting) {
    return null
  }

  // TODO write more code
}
```
</CodeWave>

Of course this project wouldn't be complete without the final color picker.

<ColorPicker width={800} height={600} />

*This project has been built with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using the theme: [Gatsby Waves](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-theme-waves/).
 If you're interested in how we put it all together you can [check out our code on github](https://github.com/SceptreData/double-d-react). *
